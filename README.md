# Tiny Analytics
#### Yet another service for gathering any event statistics.

Simply deploy the service somewhere and use its API to record activity of, for example, your mobile app users.
You can send a request to that service everytime a user taps something, and you want to know about it to be able to analyze user actions later on.

_**TODO:** add deployment and usage documentation_
